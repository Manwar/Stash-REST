        - conf {params} added to make possible send data on BODY different from application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        - a little code refactory
        - WARNING: Class::Trigger callbacks now get 1 HAHSREF params instead of N [SCALAR|ARRAY]REF.
            - this will make easy add more params without breaking everything!
